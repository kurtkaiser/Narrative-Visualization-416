                <h2>Voting Participation by Race In Off-Year Elections</h2>
                    <p>
                        Increased accessibility to voting, such as voting by mail, is one reason we have seen a recent resize in election participation. However, it is not the only reason.
                        Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic voter turnout saw a dramatic increase in the congressional elections of 2018.

                    <p>
                        According to Jordan Misra, a Census.gov reporter, dramatic increases were noticeable particularly for younger voters and for people of color. These groups tend to vote Democratic. It appears that Democratic voters were motivated in part by their strong disapproval of President Trump. William H. Frey at Brookings Institute states that he noticed, “extraordinarily high levels of voter turnout among voting blocs that lean Democratic.” Motivation can have as dramatic of an impact on voter turnout as increased accessibility does.
